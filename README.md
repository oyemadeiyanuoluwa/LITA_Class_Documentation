* Unit Price: Unit price is the cost of a single unit of a product, typically expressed in terms of a standard measurement such as per item, per pound, per liter, or per kilogram. It allows consumers to compare prices more easily between different products or brands.
* Quantity: it refers to the specific number of units of a product that were sold in a transaction. It indicates how much of a particular item was purchased by a customer. Tracking quantity is important for inventory management, sales analysis, and ensuring that stock levels meet customer demand.

* Gross Margin Percentage: Gross margin percentage is a financial metric that shows the proportion of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS).
* Gross Income: Gross income refers to the total earnings of an individual or business before any deductions or taxes are applied. For businesses, it is often calculated as revenue minus the cost of goods sold (COGS).
